        A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It originated from the region between
        northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1][2] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast
        Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian
        type".[1][2] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the
        majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[3]
        
        Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape,
        sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.[4] Mango is the national fruit
        of India, Pakistan and the Philippines,[5][6] while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.[7]
        
        Etymology
        The English word mango (plural "mangoes" or "mangos") originated in the 16th century from the Portuguese word manga,
        from the Malay mangga, and ultimately from the Tamil man ("mango tree") + kay ("unripe fruit/vegetable").[8][9][10] The
        scientific name, Mangifera indica, refers to a plant bearing mangoes in India.[10]
        
        Description
        Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres (98–131 feet) tall, with a crown radius of 10–15 m (33–49 ft). The trees are
        long-lived, as some specimens still fruit after 300 years.[11]
        
        In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m (20 ft), with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor roots
        penetrating deeply into the soil.[4] The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres (6–14 inches) long,
        and 6–16 cm (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark, glossy
        red, then dark green as they mature.[4] The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each
        flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild, sweet fragrance.[4] Over
        500 varieties of mangoes are known,[4] many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop.[12] The fruit takes
        four to five months from flowering to ripening.[4]
        
        The ripe fruit varies according to cultivar in size, shape, color, sweetness, and eating quality.[4] Depending on the
        cultivar, fruits are variously yellow, orange, red, or green.[4] The fruit has a single flat, oblong pit that can be
        fibrous or hairy on the surface and does not separate easily from the pulp.[4] The fruits may be somewhat round, oval,
        or kidney-shaped, ranging from 5–25 centimetres (2–10 in) in length and from 140 grams (5 oz) to 2 kilograms (5 lb) in
        weight per individual fruit.[4] The skin is leather-like, waxy, smooth, and fragrant, with colors ranging from green to
        yellow, yellow-orange, yellow-red, or blushed with various shades of red, purple, pink, or yellow when fully ripe.[4]
        
        Ripe intact mangoes give off a distinctive resinous, sweet smell.[4] Inside the pit 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) thick is a
        thin lining covering a single seed, 4–7 cm (1.6–2.8 in) long. Mangoes have recalcitrant seeds which do not survive
        freezing and drying.[13] Mango trees grow readily from seeds, with germination success highest when seeds are obtained
        from mature fruits.[4]
